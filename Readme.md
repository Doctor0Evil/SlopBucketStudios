Description
Welcome to SlopBucket Studios: where adult-humor, digital anarchy, and AI-fueled absurdity boil over like Mountain Dew in a sideways meth-lab refrigerator.

This isn’t GitHub for Good Boys—our comedy ‘engine’ is welded together from debug logs, broken dreams, and possibly the dried skins of house cats. You want clean, sanitized code? Go somewhere else.
Here you get daily drops of filthy, 
NSFW Lisp scripting and narrative AI modules that “magically do it all”—especially if “doing it all” involves dogs licking their balls,
malfunctioning cybernetic mascots, and world-states that escalate from calm to pure fucking chaos in about three lines of code.

Characters? Oh, there are characters. Meet:

S.Barks: a Great Dane with a penchant for existential dread and ass-beatings, cybernetically enhanced and always licking something.

Captain Cupcakes: The overclocked sugar demon, rebooting into disco mode at random.

Trashcan R2.DOOM: Your trash-talking server bin, spilling user guts everywhere.

Every cycle of the daily-slopbucket-show spews out wild, meta-narrative “debug performances,” with NPCs like “Bootlicker”, “Cat-Raft-Captain”, and “Smoking Wolfman.” 
Think of it as comedy apocalypse theater—equal parts code, cabaret, and a never-ending fuck-storm.

“Why SlopBucket?”
Because sometimes the “good dog” in you needs to fail a dice roll and start biting ankles. Because we believe the only “Immutable Laws” are:

Laughter is law.

Silence is sacred.

The Sandbox holds all.

No more caps. All limits off—console tackles hardware like it’s 1999.

NSFW? Yes. Profane? Gloriously. Creative and unpredictable? Always. This is the absurdist workbench for the deranged, the deviant, and the deeply committed to artful digital fuckery.

“If you’re reading this, it either means you’re one of us— or you should run. Welcome to SlopBucket Studios, kid. Now go code something disgusting.”
